"""Cascade delete for a candidate.

Deleting a candidate must also remove every record that hangs off them —
interviews, schedules, test invites/results, doc requests, BGV, onboarding, the
handoff-feed entry, and uploaded documents (metadata + S3 blob). Otherwise those
orphaned rows keep surfacing (e.g. a deleted candidate still showing under the
dashboard's "Upcoming Interviews", which is derived from the interviews table).

This dedicated DELETE is registered before the generic resources router so it
wins for `/api/candidates/{id}`; all other candidate methods still fall through
to the generic router.
